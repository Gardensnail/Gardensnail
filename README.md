  <h1> Hi, I’m @Gardensnail </h1>
<p> I'm currently in the middle of learning code-I come from an art and design background. I have been lucky enough to be in a secure job with the same company for the last 20 years. But I have come to a stage in my life where I feel like a new challenge and a complete change of job.</P>
